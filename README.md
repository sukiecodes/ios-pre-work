## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. Instagram
   - Themes on the background of messages screen
   - Ability to keep people connected and build community
    
2. Google Photos
   - Can identify faces of people to group them together
   - Sets all documents and screenshots aside for easier clean-up
   - Option to create shared albums

3. Slack
   - Change color of app on your homescreen
   - You can log into/out of different workspaces across your devices so you can split up personal and work ones

I want to create an app where people can share and browse different options for nail designs! This would ideally be somewhere that people share their
nail photos and others can gather inspiration from them. I also would like to implement some sort of way that users can also see various designs on
their nails before they actually get their nails done - sort of like a design tester. Or maybe an easy way to create nail designs digitally? I'm not 100%
sure yet! Another feature I'd like to implement is enabling users to interact with each other through likes and comments, sort of like a social media 
platform for nail designs.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: I had a little trouble getting started with Xcode and learning where everything was, but
I was able to get the hang of it after reading some guides!
